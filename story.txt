ECLIPSE – Full Story
Prologue: The Peaceful Village

BOLT, a calm and observant boy, lives in a quiet village under the rule of a distant kingdom. He spends his days training with his father’s sword at the riverbank, dreaming of becoming a skilled swordsman.

One morning, as BOLT returns from his practice, he finds the village completely empty. Homes are abandoned, livestock roam freely, and there is no sign of his family or friends. Confused and alarmed, BOLT begins to search for clues.

Chapter 1: The First Mission – Riverbank to Village

BOLT explores the empty village and discovers footprints leading toward the main city.

Along the way, he finds a mysterious relic: a faintly glowing key.

This event triggers the first cutscene: BOLT realizes he must travel to the kingdom’s castle to uncover the truth.

Chapter 2: The City and the First Ally

BOLT reaches the kingdom’s main city, now bustling and mega-sized. When he tries to enter the castle, guards deny him entry.

While searching for another way inside:

He meets an old man, a forgotten swordsman, who asks for help in exchange for knowledge.

BOLT reluctantly gives him a mumbled promise (the sword).

The old man provides:

A blueprint of a hidden passage

Guard disguise

Warning: “Meet me again in two days at the riverbank.”
